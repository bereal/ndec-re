## Reverse-Engineering of an Old Encryption Program

One fine day another member of a cryptography chat asked about an old MS-DOS program.
It was attached to an old infosec e-book in the form of UU-encoded text and described as

> a simple, but extremely reliable program which uses original algorithms of multi-step polymorphic encryption with the use of two keys

It became an interesting challenge to reverse-engineer the program and see what it does.
This repository will contain the original program as well as my findings about it.

A stretch-goal is to reimplement the program in Python.
